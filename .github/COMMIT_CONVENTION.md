# Git Commit Message Convention

> This is adapted from [Vue's commit convention](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md).

## TL;DR:

Messages must be matched by the following regex:

```js
/^(revert: )?(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|workflow|ci|chore|types)(\(.+\))?: .{1,50}/;
```
